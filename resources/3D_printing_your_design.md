# 3D Printing Your Design

## tl;dr
Once your design is ready, you are one step away from printing. The maximum dimensions a Replicator+ can print is **25x20x15** cm<sup>3</sup>.

You can submit a job for printing following [this link](http://3dprinting.eng.unimelb.edu.au/#submit). Before clicking “Submit a Job” (*first time users will be asked to register*), it is worthwhile checking the PDF files at the bottom of the page if this guide is not detailed enough. Upon clicking “Submit a Job”, you will then be taken to an MSE-ran Makerbot page, where instructions on how to 3D print can also be found.

**We have created our own simple guide for 3D printing the members of ARES, which you can find below.**

## Converting Files
Before your team can print the different drone parts, you must convert your **Solidworks** files to a file format suitable for 3D printing (*in this case .print*). The University of Melbourne uses a program called ***MakerBot Print***. [Click here](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/download/) to download this software.

Once that is done, ensure that you have a [**separate Solidworks file for each drone component**](#) (e.g. if you’re building a quadcopter with 4 *identical* arms & 2 *identical* main frames, you need 2 different files: one containing the arm & the other containing the frame).

Once downloaded, open your Solidworks file using Makerbot (or just simply drag & drop it onto Makerbot) & convert it into a .print file. Do the same for every other unique part.

## Submitting a Job
When every file has been processed into .print format, follow [this link](http://3dprinting.eng.unimelb.edu.au/#submit) to 3D print your drone. Log into your account (or sign up) and click  [**New Print**](#). If, for example, you are printing out 4 arms and 2 main frames, you will need to do this whole process a total of **6 times** (4 + 2).

-   In the *Project Name* field, enter [**Researcher/Staff**](#)
-   In the *filament information* section, leave material as [**PLA**](#)
-   Choose any *colour* you like
-   **Leave *quantity* as 1** (changing this will result in your print request being rejected)
-   Uplaod [**.print**](#) file
-   Leave [*Assembly required*](#) unchecked
-   **In the *special* note section, enter the following**:  [*Print request for the Aerospace and Rocket Engineering Society (UMSU affiliated) – for educational use*](#)


Click Next & **take note of your request #** as you will need this when picking up your drone parts. You will receive an email notifying you of your successful submission and then later on, another email notifying you whether the operator has approved or rejected your print request.

Once printed, you can collect each successful print from the front of the Engineering Workshop in a brown paper bag with your request # on it.
